# Sense-Hat-Temp-Notifier
Allows a raspberry pi with the Sense hat to e-mail and display temperatures

This project was created to allow easy and cheap deployment of temprature sensors around distant server rooms. This both displays the temprature and will e-mail, by default it's ip address and temprature, to the e-mail account you set up for it.
